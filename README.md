## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

I learned how to "change" an image on hover. I put it in quotation marks because it's more of a trick than an actual change. What really happens is that I change the display property of the image that i want to hide to none and the display of the image that I want to make visible to block.

### Useful resources

- [content CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) - I recommend this article to anyone who wants to understand this property in more detail.
